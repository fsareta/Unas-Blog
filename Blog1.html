            <h2>The Evolution of Technology in Education</h2>
            <p> Isn't it interesting how technology has changed and transformed the way we learn? Here is a link to a
                great site that shows a brief timeline of important technology throughout
                the years in schools:
                <a href="https://www.gradschools.com/degree-guide/technology-in-the-classroom-timeline-curriculum-planning"
                    target="_blank">Timeline</a>
            </p>

            <h2>What is EdTech?</h2>
            <p>
                Edtech is when schools incorporate IT tools into the classroom to create a more engaging, inclusive and
                individualized learning experience.</p>

            <h2>The Future of Technology in Education</h2>
            <p> I'm interested to see how technology continues to improve classrooms. As
                a young child, I would've never thought
                that schools could ever be taught through video call, but the pandemic happened and almost every school
                was teaching
                through Zoom. I even read an article about robots in schools! I've been inspired by so many educational
                technology
                out there.

                helpful to watch:
