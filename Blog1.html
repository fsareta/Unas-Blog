 <h1>The Evolution of Technology in Schools</h1>
 <h3>History of technology in education</h3>

 <p> Here is a link to a great site that shows a brief timeline of important technology throughout 
     the years in schools:

 <h3>Technological advances when I went to school</h3>
 <p>I think it's fascinating how much technology has advanced through the years in schools.
When I was in elementary school we had whiteboards and overhead projectors. By middle school, they had smartboards in every classroom. The smartboards were so cool
because it was interactive. 
In middle school, every student was given a laptop to use for the majority of our school work. That was when
they really started to push the importance of technology and math. In high school, I enrolled in a tech academy and I enjoyed it.

 <h3>The future of technology in education</h3>
 <p> I'm interested to see how technology continues to advance in schools. As a young child, I would've never thought
     that school could ever be taught through video call, but the pandemic happened and almost every school was teaching 
     through Zoom. Technology has really made a lot of things possible. I've been inspired by so many educational technology and 
     I hope to contribute in some way in order to help other students as well.
