 <h1>The Evolution of Technology in Schools</h1>
 <h3>History of technology in education</h3>

 <p> Here is a link to a great site that shows a brief timeline of important technology throughout 
     the years in schools:

 <h3>Technological advances when I went to school</h3>
 <p>I think it's fascinating how much technology has advanced through the years in schools.
When I was in elementary school we had whiteboards and overhead projectors. By middle school, they had smartboards in every classroom. The smartboards were so cool
because it was interactive. 
In middle school, every student was given a laptop to use for the majority of our school work. That is when
they really started to push technology and math to the forefront. STEM became a huge topic around that time. They 
even started setting up STEM schools and technology programs. I was a part of a Tech Academy in high school, a choice program offered to all
student in the Kent School District. This meant that it didn't matter if you lived outside the boundaries of the high school,
transportation would be provided. That was really nice because I lived far, but I was still able to enroll in the program.

 <h3>The future of technology in education</h3>
 <p> I'm interested to see how technology continues to advance in schools. As a young child, I would've never thought
     that school could ever be taught through video call, but the pandemic happened and almost every school was teaching 
     through Zoom. Technology has really made a lot of things possible.
