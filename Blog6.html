    <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
    <p>Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. Machine Learning allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. 
        Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values. Big companies such Facebook
    , Google, and Uber use machine learning.</p>
    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <p>I've always been interested in AI after taking a college class called Philosophy of Mind. 
        Some questions that we had to think about are: Are human intelligence and machine intelligence the same? Is the human brain essentially a computer?
        Can a machine have a mind, mental states, and consciousness in the same sense that a human being can? Can it feel how things are?
        They are interesting questions but I honestly don't like philosophy haha. I'm interested in machine learning and I want to learn more.
