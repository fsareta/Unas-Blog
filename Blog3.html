          <h2>What is Pacific Hackathon?</h2>
    <p>Pacific Hackathon is a competitive event that brings technologists and interested persons from 
        around the region to develop a solution for the client. This year's client was <a href="http://www.piango.org/" target="_blank">Pacific Island Association of NGOs (PIANGO).</a>  
     The client expressed their challenge as an organization and their hope for a solution. They list what their ideal platform would do and look like in order to solve
     their problems. Participants in the event
work in groups to submit their platforms, which could be an app or website. Winners receive prizes. To read more about this event, <a href="https://picisoc.devpost.com/" target="_blank">click here.</a> </p>
<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p> As a Samoan, it made me happy to see other Pacific Islander programmers out there. It's encouraging to see people like me have the same
    dreams and goals. I watched the winner's presentation about the application that they developed
    and it was so cool to see how knowledgeable and professional they were. Maybe one day I could also participate in this event.
