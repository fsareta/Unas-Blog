    <h1>Android vs. iOS App Development</h1>
    <p> I have been debating if I should develop an Android or iOS application. There are many pros and cons for both.
        Android uses Kotlin or Java, while iOS uses Swift, which is a modern programming language specifically designed 
        for Apple products. This link shares a comparison table between Android and iOS: https://www.diffen.com/difference/Android_vs_iOS.
        Personally, I'm an Android fan.

    <p>For my project, I wanted to create an app for iPads because special ed programs use these, but the program I needed to download, XCode, required
        a Mac computer, which I don't have. So I've decided to create an Android App instead. Android applications
        can be used on multiple platforms and targets different consumer bases. </p>
