    <h2>What is Proloquo2Go?</h2>
    <p> Many people with different communication difficulties, speech impediment or disorder benefits from
        using this app called Proloquo2Go. A few of the students I've worked with use it to 
   communicate. This really interested me and made me appreciate the many assistive technologies out there for students
   with disabilities.

    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <p>This app inspires me to create an app that could also help other students with different disabilities. Looking through their 
        website, I've discovered that they do extensive research and clinical studies to best meet the needs of those who need this tool. Their 
        app is designed and organized to be convenient for the user. They also make it very customizable to suit the user's different needs and preferences. 
        I want to keep these all in mind when thinking of the project I want to work on.
