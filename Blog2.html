            <h2>What is Proloquo2Go?</h2>
            <img src="images/proloquo.png" alt="proloquo2go on iPad">
            <p> Many people with different communication difficulties, speech impediment or disorder benefits from
                using this app called <b>Proloquo2Go.</b> A few of the students I've worked with use it to
                communicate. I thought it was so cool. It made me appreciate the many assistive technologies out there
                for students
                with disabilities.
            </p>
            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>This app inspires me to create an app or program that could also help other students with different
                disabilities. Looking through their
                website, I've discovered that they do extensive research and clinical studies to best meet the needs of
                those who need this tool. Their
                app is designed and organized to be convenient for the user. They also make it very customizable to suit
                the user's different needs and preferences.
                I want to keep these all in mind when thinking of the project I want to work on.
